Repository for the future testing of CPMpy with the use of differential testing and metamorphic testing.
It also will contain a tool to reduce the model in case a bug is found and a way to obtain CPMpy models to test CPMpy using the two techniques above.



This repository builds futher on the work of the thesis by Ruben Kindt which was under guidance of Tias Guns and Ignace Bleukx.
